# TrackingAndExpenseParser
An automation script that parsed invoice and PDF's and excel files to obtain necessary information for tracking. Helped our excavation manager process invoices and reports of excavations into an excel spreadsheet.

This was the second ever python script I had written ever. There is likely different ways to approach this problem but wanted to create a streamlined and user friendly workflow to parse the files.

Comments within the file itself provide a good introduction to how the script was used. The additional txt files included are to show the contents of which were parsed from PDF files. All information contained within the text files is no longer used and is thus safe to have hosted online.
